        <h1>Box desing folio</h1>
        <p2>Thomas(Miko) slaughter</p2>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Small item storage is a common issue that is encountered in households and offices.<br>
            They can be but are not limited to items like jewellery, pens, pencils and mobile phones or tablets.<br>
            Having an aesthetically pleasing storage system that will securely hold these items can help an
            individual<br>
            organise their space more efficiently while still remaining pleasing to the user. </p>
        <h2>The Task</h2>
        <p>Your task is to create a small storage box with a tray, you will design a custom pattern for the lid and base
            of your box.<br>
            The design will include at least one specialised joint that you have researched prior to producing the
            project.<br>
            You must document your research, thoughts and ideas in the following pages of this design folio. All
            work<br>
            must be your own, however, you may get assistance from your parents, siblings, or other family members
            to<br>
            develop your ideas. </p>
        <h2>Restrictions</h2>
        <p>Your design cannot have a length or width greater than 250mm or a height greater than 150mm.<br>
            Shenton College will only supply Pine and a limited amount of Jarrah timber for your production. If you<br>
            require any other timber type this must be provided by you.<br>
            Fittings such as hinges and latches must all be supplied by you. Due to the high cost and many different<br>
            types available it is not feasible for Shenton to stock all types fittings.</p>

        <h2>Statement of Intent</h2>
        <p>I am tasked with designing a small wooden box that can’t be bigger than 250mm x 250mm x 150mm. I like
            jarrah<br>
            with a small amount of pine, don’t intend to use hinges. I plan on having a stain pine inlay in the lid
            of<br>
            the storage unit to make it more aesthetically pleasing while having small compartments within the unit
            for<br>
            more storage. This storage unit is being made for myself because its cool.</p>

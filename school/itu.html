    <h1> Indigenous Australians Timber Uses</h1>
    <pre>All throughout the world the sound of a boomerang is known, it is also known for its seemingly 
        magical ability to return back to the thrower. The boomerang has been recreated many times by many
         different people, but still remains an aboriginal invention. A boomerang was traditionally used for 
         hunting (birds, kangaroos and marsupials), fighting, digging and as a dance accessory or percussion 
         instrument, it is now used more commonly as a toy.
 
        Retuning boomerangs are traditionally made from the roots of Mulga or black wattle, the roots are 
        used because the shape is very close to the shape needed. It is important that the boomerang follows 
        the grain of the wood, so the tips donâ€™t brake when it hits the ground.
         
        Boomerangs where constructed from a root with a shape and grain similar to a boomerang. Having a 
        boomerang shape in the grain of the wood means that the tip of the boomerang is less likely to break 
        off if it hits the ground. The root is removed from the tree and is carved into shape. Traditionally, 
        decorations on boomerangs are done by carving, burning or painting. Others are clan designs, which only 
        a few related people are allowed to use. When being used in a ceremonially, the designs relate to the ceremony.
         
        In conclusion the boomerang was an amazing invention that revolutionized traditional hunting and gathering.

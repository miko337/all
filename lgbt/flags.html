    <h1>The diferent pribe flags and what they mean.</h1>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay"><img src="imiges/03-pride_flags.jpg" style="width:50%"></a>
    <h3>Traditional Gay Pride Flag</h3>
    <pre>This is the most familiar flag. In 1979, the community landed on this six-color version, 
    which was hung from lampposts in San Francisco. Numerous complications over having an odd-number 
    of colors led to turquoise being dropped, at least according to reports.</pre>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisexuality"><img src="imiges/06-pride_flags.jpg" style="width:50%"></a>
    <h3>Bisexual Pride Flag</h3>
    <pre>Designed by Michael Page, the flag brings visibility to the bisexual community, 
   showing the overlap of the stereotypical colors for boys and girls. The flag was inspired 
   by an older symbol of bisexuality: the "biangles," two overlapping pink and dark blue triangles.</pre>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pansexuality"><img src="imiges/07-pride_flags.jpg" style="width:50%"></a>
    <h3>Pansexual Pride Flag</h3>
    <pre>Created on the web in 2010, this flag has colors that represent pansexuality's interest
    in all genders as partners. The pink represents women, yellow nonbinary and gender-nonconforming 
    people, and the blue is for men.</pre>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexuality#:~:text=Asexuality%20is%20the%20lack%20of,orientation%20or%20the%20lack%20thereof."><img src="imiges/08-pride_flags.jpg" style="width:50%"></a>
    <h3>Asexual Pride Flag</h3>
    <pre>Like the pansexual flag, the asexual flag was created in 2010. Inspired by the Asexual 
   Visibility and Education Network logo, it represents many ace identities, including graysexuals 
   (the fluid area between sexuals and asexuals) and demisexuals (people who don't experience sexual 
   attraction unless they have an emotional connection with their partners).</pre>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamory#:~:text=Polyamory%20(from%20Greek%20%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%BB%CF%8D%20poly,and%20responsible%20non%2Dmonogamy%22."><img src="imiges/10-pride_flags.png" style="width:50%"></a>
    <h3>Polyamory Pride Flag</h3>
    <pre>Featuring the symbol for the infinite numberpi, which shares the first letter of "polyamory," 
   this flag celebrates the infinite selection of partners available to polyamorous people. The letter 
   is gold to represent the emotional attachment we have with others as friends and romantic partnerss,
    rather than just our carnal relationships.</pre>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex"><img src="imiges/11-pride_flags.png" style="width:50%"></a>
    <h3>Intersex Pride Flag</h3>
    <pre>Designed in 2013 by the organization Intersex International Australia, this flag intentionally 
      features nongendered colors that celebrate living outside the binary. </pre>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex"><img src="imiges/12-pride_flags.jpg" style="width:50%"></a>
    <h3>Transgender Pride Flag</h3>
    <pre>Monica Helms, a trans woman, designed this flag in 1999, and it was first flown at a Pride 
      Parade in Phoenix a year later. “The light blue is the traditional color for baby boys, pink is 
      for girls, and the white in the middle is for those who are transitioning, those who feel they have 
      a neutral gender or no gender, and those who are intersexed,” Helms noted. “The pattern is such that
       no matter which way you fly it, it will always be correct. This symbolizes us trying to find 
       correctness in our own lives.”</pre>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender"><img src="imiges/13-pride_flags.jpg" style="width:50%"></a>
    <h3>Genderfluid/Genderflexible Pride Flag</h3>
    <pre>Encompassing the fluctuations and the flexibility of gender in genderfluid people, the flag features 
      colors associated with femininity, masculinity, and everything in between. The pink stands for femininity. 
      The white represents the lack of gender. The purple represents the combination of masculinity and femininity. 
      The black symbolizes all genders, including third genders. The blue reflects masculinity.</pre>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender"><img src="imiges/14-pride_flags.jpg" style="width:50%"></a>
    <h3>Genderqueer Pride Flag</h3>
    <pre>Created in 2011 by Marilyn Roxie, the genderqueer flag highlights androgyny with lavender, agender 
      identities with white, and nonbinary people with green. Some people refer to it as a nonbinary flag if 
      they feel queer is a slur.
    </pre>

    <a href="https://lgbta.wikia.org/wiki/Polysexual"><img src="imiges/19-pride_flags.png" style="width:50%"></a>
    <h3>Polysexual Pride Flag</h3>
    <pre>Polysexuality, unlike pansexuality, is the attraction to multiple genders but not all. A middle 
      ground between bisexuality and pansexuality, it is centered more around attractions to femininity and 
      masculinity rather than gender itself. The pink represents attraction to females; the blue for males. 
      The green is for an attraction to those who don't conform to either gender. </pre>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender#:~:text=Agender%20people%20('a%2D',being%20without%20a%20gender%20identity."><img src="imiges/20-pride_flags.jpg" style="width:50%"></a>
    <h3>Agender Pride Flag</h3>
    <pre>While genderqueer people bend the rules of gender, agender people reject a gender completely. 
      For their flag, the black and white stripes represent the absence of gender, while green, the inverse of the 
      gender-heavy purple, represents nonbinary genders.</pre>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="http://wiki.asexuality.org/Aromantic"><img src="imiges/21-pride_flags.jpg" style="width:50%"></a>
    <h3>Aromantic Pride Flag</h3>
    <pre>While asexual flags use purple to show their lack of sexual attraction, aromantic flags use green to celebrate
       the people who live without romantic attraction.</pre>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender"><img src="imiges/22-pride_flags.jpg" style="width:50%"></a>
    <h3>Non Binary Pride Flag</h3>
    <pre>Created by 17-year-old Kye Rowan in 2014, this flag was a response to nonbinary people feeling 
      improperly represented by the genderqueer flag. This symbol was not to replace Roxie's creation but sit 
      beside it as an option. The yellow symbolizes gender outside a binary. The white, a mix of all colors, 
      represents those with many or all genders. Purple stands in for those who feel both binary male and female 
      or fluid between them. The black is for the agender community, without sexuality or color.
